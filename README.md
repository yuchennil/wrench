# Double Ratchet

This crate provides a Rust implementation of Signal Protocol's
[double ratchet](https://signal.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/)
algorithm.

DO NOT USE THIS LIBRARY. I am deliberately rolling my own crypto as a learning
project. This code has not undergone any security review. I make no guarantees
that Mossad won't bust down your door if you rely on this library. If you need
actual security, I recommend Signal's
[reference implementation](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-protocol-java).
